Welcome to my site. Hopefully you find some of this information useful. Although I am mainly doing it as a way to learn and document things I learn. This first page is some links that have helped me.

{% if post.excerpt != post.content %}
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">Read more</a>
{% endif %}

Useful Links - things I find useful for developing

- [Learn Github branch](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  - Good visual tool to learn Git, I like that you can see what git is doing with different commands
