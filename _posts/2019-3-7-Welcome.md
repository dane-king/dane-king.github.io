Welcome to my site. Hopefully you find some of this information useful. Although I am mainly doing it as a way to learn and document things I learn. This first page is some links that have helped me.

### Links I find useful

- [Learn Github branch](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  - Good visual tool to learn Git, I like that you can see what git is doing with different commands. The sandbox is so useful when you are trying out something.
- [Learn Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
  - Good visual tool to learn Flexbox and it's fun too. I still go back to this ever once in awhile.
