### Setup NPM so you don't need sudo
[Source] (http://michaelb.org/the-right-way-to-do-global-npm-install-without-sudo/)

+ Step 1: Configure NPM
  + npm config set prefix ~/.local  
  + Now NPM will install your global executables to ~/.local/bin, and the libraries to ~/.local/lib/node_modules/

+ Step 2: Add ~/.local/bin to your path
  + edit ~/.bashrc:
  + PATH=~/.local/bin/:$PATH
  + source ~/.bashrc
