This is a page of some links that have helped me with a brief description

<!-- ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png) -->
{% if post.excerpt != post.content %}
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">Read more</a>
{% endif %}

### Links I find useful

- [Learn Github branch](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
  - Good visual tool to learn Git, I like that you can see what git is doing with different commands. The sandbox is so useful when you are trying out something.
- [Learn Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
  - Good visual tool to learn Flexbox and it's fun too. I still go back to this ever once in awhile.
